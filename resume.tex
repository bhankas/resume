{\textbf{Sarcasm Detection using Machine Learning}} \hfill Jan 2019 - Jun-2019\\
\textit{Python, Pytorch, SpaCy, sklearn, Pandas, Numpy} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detect sarcasm in textual communication by understanding content as well as context of the particular comment as well as past record of the person making the comment to include known sarcastic comments.\\
  \item Reddit comment database was cleaned and analyzed to generate profile for authors for their propensity to be sarcastic. Multiple paramters were used to determine whether a comment can be sarcastic or not, including, but not limited to specific words being used, comment popularity, topic of discussion, sentiment analysis etc.
  \item Python was used as primary development language for mature Machine Learning echosystem, for data cleaning, model construction, training and evaluation. Bash and other GNU tools were used for preliminary data analysis and cleaning.

{\textbf{Magnetic Levitation using Real-time PID}} \hfill Jan 2016 - Jun 2016\\
\textit{C, Arduino} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item A single controlled electromagnet is used to suspend ferromagnetic object at fixed position. The control mechanism implements PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) algorithm to asses object location and velocity to adapt magnetic field strength in real time for indefinite suspension of ferromagnetic object.\\
  \item Minimal power, hardware, software and configuration requirements. Modular architecture and scalable design with multiple possible applications.
